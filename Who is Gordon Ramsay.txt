"Chef Ramsay was intensely demanding with high, near-impossible standards in his kitchen. He was relentless at noticing the tiniest errors and unafraid to loudly voice criticism when the quality didn't meet his expectations. His blunt harshness could be jarring for new cooks unused to his fiery passion. Yet his sharp eye uncovered details others missed, pushing them to levels they didn't know they could reach. Behind closed doors, his mentees also glimpsed a warmer side, revealing a deep care for the craft, insight into their potential, and patience for those clearly striving to excel."
